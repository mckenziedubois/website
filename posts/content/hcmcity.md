## Where (not) to Stay in Ho Chi Minh City

### De La Sol Apartments (District 4)

We stayed at **De La Sol Apartments in District 4**, located about 15 minutes from District 1, the city center. District 4 was an ideal home base because it offered a quieter, more local feel while still being close to major attractions.

If you only have a few days in Ho Chi Minh City or want to be within walking distance of most sights, **District 1** is the most convenient area to stay.

## Best Things to Do in Ho Chi Minh City

### Cafe Apartments (Nguyen Hue Walking Street)

The **Cafe Apartments** are a must-see in HCM City. This multi-story apartment building has been converted into dozens of unique cafes, boutiques, and dining spots. Half the fun is exploring and discovering a favorite on your own, though I’ve saved several recommendations in my Google Maps guide. There is a small fee to take the elevator to the top, but you can also walk up the stairs for free.

### Saigon Central Post Office

The **Saigon Central Post Office** is one of the most beautiful historical buildings in the city. Inside, you’ll find high ceilings, detailed murals, and a variety of postcards and souvenirs for sale. We sent three postcards home, all of which arrived successfully. An easy and meaningful souvenir that doesn’t take up luggage space.

### Ben Thanh Market

If you’re looking to do all your shopping in one place, **Ben Thanh Market** is the spot. You’ll find everything from knock-off handbags and watches to Vietnamese goods made locally or in China. Haggling is expected here. A helpful tip: walking away often results in getting the price you want.

### Grab Bike Experience

Ho Chi Minh City is often called the **motorbike capital of the world**, and riding on the back of one is an essential experience. Using **Grab Bike** is usually faster than taking a car, especially during rush hour. If you’re short on time or want to experience the city like a local, Grab Bike is the way to go.

### Cu Chi Tunnels Day Tour

The **Cu Chi Tunnels** are a nearly full-day excursion from Ho Chi Minh City and provide insight into Vietnam’s history during the **Vietnam War**. The tour includes visits to preserved tunnels and several planned activities covered by your ticket price. There is also an optional add-on to shoot an AK-47 or other automatic weapons if that interests you. We booked our tour through GetYourGuide, which you can find [here.](https://www.getyourguide.com/ho-chi-minh-city-l272/ho-chi-minh-city-cu-chi-tunnels-luxury-group-tour-ampm-t195248/)

## Where to Eat in Ho Chi Minh City

### Ben Nghe Street Food Market

**Ben Nghe Street Food Market** is an approachable introduction to Vietnamese street food. It offers a wide variety of dishes and plenty of outdoor seating, making it a great place to sample multiple foods in one stop.

### Pizza 4P’s

If you’re craving pizza, **Pizza 4P’s** is one of the best spots in Ho Chi Minh City. Asia does pizza exceptionally well, and this restaurant lives up to the hype. Reservations can be difficult to secure, but there are several locations throughout the city, increasing your chances of getting a table.

## Additional Travel Tips for Ho Chi Minh City

Ho Chi Minh City was our final stop in Vietnam after more than three weeks of traveling, so we slowed down a bit on adventurous eating. Our Airbnb also had two incredible pools, which were essential for escaping the city heat.

One of our favorite meals came from wandering District 4 and spotting a group of middle-school-aged kids eating something that looked incredible. When we asked where they got it, they told us their friend made it—and offered to text him. We sat down at the café next door, ordered drinks, and soon a man arrived with two plates of crispy pork, rice, vegetables, and hot sauce.

From our time in **Hanoi** and **Da Nang**, we learned an important rule: the smaller the chair, the better the phở. The **Michelin Guide Vietnam** is also an excellent resource for narrowing down which of the hundreds of Vietnamese restaurants are worth visiting and almost guarantees a delicious meal.
