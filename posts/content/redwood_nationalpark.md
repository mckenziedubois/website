Located 7 hours north of San Francisco is Redwood National Park. The park is comprised of both National and State parks. 
The park starts just south of the California/Oregon border and continues South towards Trinidad, California. If you're short on time I would suggest staying somewhere between Crescent City and Trinidad for the easiest access to both the National park and it's adjacent state parks. 

### Where to Stay

We opted for two airbnbs during our stay. Gold Beach, Oregon located just about an hour north of the California/Oregon border and Trinidad the town that aligns with the southern tip of the National Park. 

- **Gold Beach** <small>Charming home with ocean views and easy access to local trails. This home is located on Hwy 1, along a long stretch of gorgeous coastline.  If you're interesting in spending some time ocean side, I would highly recommend making you're way up the coast into Oregon and enjoying the famous coastline not far from the state line.</small> 
- **Trinidad** <small>Cozy cabin near the coast, perfect for exploring nearby beaches and parks. The town itself was charming and had everything we needed to be comfortable, there is not a lot going between Trinidad and Crescent City, so I would recommend staying here if you like having access to restaurants, grocery stores, etc.</small>  

### What to do

- **Big Trees Trail** <small>Walk among ancient redwoods on this iconic trail. This trail requires a permit, reciept of the permit comes with a code to open the gate at the entrance to the drive down to the trail parking lot. </small>
- **Klamath River Overlook** <small>Scenic views of the Klamath River meeting the Pacific Ocean.</small>
- **Trinidad State Beach** <small>Tide pools, beach walks, and stunning sunsets.</small>
- **Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park - Grove of Titans Trailhead** <small>Explore one of the most impressive redwood groves in the park.*</small>
- **Meyers Creek Beach** <small>A quiet beach, ideal for picnics and coastal walks.</small>

### Where to eat

- **Groundling Pizza Co** <small>Casual pizza place with local ingredients.</small>
- **Beachcomber Cafe** <small>Cozy café serving breakfast and seafood near the shore.</small>
- **Historic Hiouchi Cafe** <small>Local diner with classic American breakfast and lunch fare.</small>

### Skip

- **Trees of Mystery** <small>Touristy and often crowded; not recommended if you prefer quiet nature walks. My recommendation is to snap a picture with Paul Bunyon and his blue ox and get out of there!</small>
