Hey thanks for checking out my page and being interested in what I've been up to this past year. 

For some context, in January 2025 I was impacted by layoffs, rather than jumping into my next role I decided to take the year away from San Francisco and do quite a lot of traveling. 

In early February, my partner and I moved out of our Nob Hill apartment in San Francisco. 

Phase 1 started with a one way ticket to Japan. We spent 4.5 months in Asia and visited 9 total countries:

- Japan
- Korea
- Vietnam
- Cambodia
- Thailand
- Malaysia
- Singapore
- Indonesia
- Philippines

Hard to summarize 4.5 epic months in one of the most beautiful parts of our world but some of my favorite memories include:

- Getting caught in the snow outside of Byodoin Temple in Uji, Japan
- Seeing the sunrise over Angkor Wat in Siem Riep, Cambodia
- Getting PADI Open Water certified in Phuket, Thailand
- AND PADI <b>Advanced</b> Open Water Certified in Komodo National Park and Gili Air, Indonesia
- Celebrating Song Kran and playing water in the streets of Chiang Mai, Thailand
- Catching Lady Gaga's Mayhem Ball at Singapore National Stadium 


Phase 2 consisted of visiting every national park in Washington State and most importantly completeing the 93 mile Wonderland Trail around the base of Mount Rainier. 

- Mount Rainier National Park
- North Cascades National Park
- Olympic National Park

In addition to the Wonderland Trail, we swam in ice cold Lake Diablo in North Cascades and hiked over 30 miles along the Blue Glacier trail through the Hoh Rainforest in Olympic National Park. 

Phase 3 was our 3000 mile roadtrip, major stops included

- Whistler, Canada (Our 10th country of the year)
- Yoho National Park 
- Banff National Park
- Kananaskis 
- Waterton National Park
- Glacier National Park 
- Yellowstone National Park 
- Grand Teton National Park
- Sawtooth Mountain Range in Idaho
- Hood River, Oregon
- Portland Oregon

Phase 4 - Part 1

After nearing 10 months of traveling we spent some time with out Seattle family and then headed back to the east coast to see our families but the travel didn't stop

- Raleigh, North Carolina
- Asheville, North Carolina
- Boone, North Carolina
- Chicago, Illinois

Phase 5

Our final country of the year was Mexico, we spent 3 weeks in December in Mexico city.
