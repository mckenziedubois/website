Thanks for being interested in what I’ve been up to this past year.

#### Asia (February - June)
Travel kicked off in early February with a one-way ticket to Japan. Over the next five months, I spent time across Asia and visited nine countries:
- Japan
- Korea
- Vietnam
- Cambodia
- Thailand
- Malaysia
- Singapore
- Indonesia
- Philippines

It’s hard to summarize one of the most beautiful and diverse parts of the world, but a few standout moments include:
- Getting caught in the snow outside Byodoin Temple in Uji, Japan
- Watching the sunrise over Angkor Wat in Siem Reap, Cambodia
- Earning my PADI Open Water certification in Phuket, Thailand, followed by Advanced Open Water certification in Komodo National Park and Gili Air, Indonesia
- Celebrating Songkran in the streets of Chiang Mai, Thailand
- Catching Lady Gaga’s Mayhem Ball at Singapore National Stadium

#### Washington State (June - July) 

In June and July, I visited every national park in Washington State; Mount Rainier, North Cascades, and Olympic. Completed the 93-mile Wonderland Trail around Mount Rainier. Highlights included swimming in the cold waters of Diablo Lake, hiking over 30 miles along the Blue Glacier Trail through the Hoh Rainforest, and spending days fully immersed in the mountains.

#### The Roadtrip (August - September) 

August marked the start of a 3,000+ mile road trip, with major stops including:

- Whistler, Canada
- Yoho National Park
- Banff National Park
- Kananaskis
- Waterton National Park
- Glacier National Park
- Yellowstone National Park
- Grand Teton National Park
- Twin Falls, Idaho
- Sawtooth Mountains, Idaho
- Hood River, Oregon
- Portland, Oregon

Along the way, I hiked the Alice-Toxaway Loop in the Sawtooths, had a very close encounter with a grizzly bear on Glacier’s Highline Trail, and spent nearly two weeks backpacking and exploring Yellowstone.

#### Family and Final Trips (October - December) 

After almost nine months of continuous travel, I returned briefly to Seattle to spend time with family before heading east to see the rest of ours. The travel didn’t stop there, honorable mentions include:

- Christmas in Raleigh, North Carolina
- Snow flurries and 70-degree days in Asheville, North Carolina
- An App State football game in Boone, North Carolina
- Thanksgiving in Chicago, Illinois
- December in Mexico City, Mexico

After more than 11 months away from California, I’m back in San Francisco and picking up where I left off.

#### What This Year Taught Me 
One of the biggest takeaways from this year was perspective. During months of extended travel, I met remarkably few Americans doing the same. It reinforced how rare it is, especially in the U.S., to step away from work long enough to fully experience the world.

Travel also deepened my appreciation for home. There is real beauty in routine, in familiarity, and in the daily life I often take for granted. Experiencing so many different cultures and ways of living made returning to those routines feel meaningful rather than mundane.

Nearly everyone I met along the way said the same thing: you’re making the right decision. I agree. If you have the time and the means, do it, I promise you will not regret it. 

Thanks for reading. I plan to share more detailed guides from many of these places and my travels prior to 2025. 

Stay tuned.
