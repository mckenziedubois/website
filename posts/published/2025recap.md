Thanks for being interested in what I’ve been up to this past year.

#### Asia (February - June)
Travel kicked off in early February with a one-way ticket to Japan. Over the next five months, I spent time across Asia and visited nine countries: Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines. 

It’s hard to summarize one of the most beautiful and diverse parts of the world, but a few standout moments include:

- Getting caught in the snow outside Byodoin Temple in Uji, Japan
- Watching the sunrise over Angkor Wat in Siem Reap, Cambodia
- Earning my PADI Open Water certification in Phuket, Thailand, followed by Advanced Open Water certification in Komodo National Park and Gili Air, Indonesia
- Celebrating Songkran in the streets of Chiang Mai, Thailand
- Catching Lady Gaga’s Mayhem Ball at Singapore National Stadium

#### Washington State (June - July) 

In June and July, I visited every national park in Washington State: Mount Rainier, North Cascades, and Olympic. I also completed the 93-mile Wonderland Trail around Mount Rainier. Some other highlights included swimming in the cold waters of Diablo Lake (pictured in the cover image), hiking over 30 miles along the Blue Glacier Trail through the Hoh Rainforest, and spending days fully immersed in the mountains.

#### The Roadtrip (August - September) 

August marked the start of an eight-week, 3,000+ mile road trip that spanned Western Canada and the American West. The route included Whistler and the Canadian Rockies (Yoho, Banff, Kananaskis, and Waterton), continued through Montana and Wyoming (Glacier, Kalispell, Yellowstone, and Grand Teton), and wrapped through Idaho and Oregon, ending in Portland. If you're interested in my full route with all my stops, please check out my Google Maps map below. 

Along the way, I hiked the Alice-Toxaway Loop in the Sawtooths, had a very close encounter with a grizzly bear on Glacier’s Highline Trail, and spent nearly two weeks backpacking and exploring Yellowstone.

Between our time in Washington and the road trip we spent 40 nights camping at over 30 different campsites, with 25 nights spent in the backcountry. 

#### Family and Final Trips (October - December) 

I returned briefly to Seattle in October to spend time with family before heading east to see the rest of ours. The travel didn’t stop there, honorable mentions include:

- Christmas in Raleigh, North Carolina
- Flurries and 70 degree days in Asheville, North Carolina 
- An App State football game in Boone, North Carolina
- Thanksiving snowstorms in Chicago, Illinois
- Mexico City apartment for 3 weeks in December

After just under a year of travel, I’m back in San Francisco and picking up where I left off.

#### What This Year Taught Me 
During months of extended travel, I met almost no Americans traveling long-term. The few I encountered were typically limited to short trips dictated by PTO. In many other countries, extended time for family and life experience is not an exception but an expectation. 

In the US not only are we working so much to not be able to step away to accomplish other life goals, there is also an unspoken stigma around stepping away from work for any extended period. Time off is often viewed as a lack of ambition rather than a meaningful investment in life experience. 

Travel also deepened my appreciation for home. There is real beauty in routine, in familiarity, and in the daily life I often take for granted. Experiencing so many different cultures and ways of living made returning to those routines feel meaningful rather than mundane.

Thanks for reading. The Google Maps map below showcases my full Asia itinerary and complete road trip route. I plan to share more detailed guides from these places and from my other travels prior to 2025.

Stay tuned.
