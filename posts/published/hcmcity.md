Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), formerly known as Saigon, is one of Vietnam’s most vibrant and fast-paced cities. From historic landmarks and bustling markets to incredible food and motorbike-filled streets, this guide covers where to stay, what to do, and where to eat in HCMC based on my firsthand experience.

#### Where to Stay in Ho Chi Minh City

We stayed at De La Sol Apartments in District 4, located about 15 minutes from the city center. District 4 was an ideal home base because it offered a quieter, more local feel while still being close to major attractions. If you only have a few days in HCMC or want to be within walking distance of most sights, I would recommend staying in District 1 over District 4. 

#### Best Things to Do in Ho Chi Minh City

**Cafe Apartments (Nguyễn Huệ Walking Street)** is a must-see in HCMC. This multi-story apartment building has been converted into dozens of unique cafes, boutiques, and dining spots. Half the fun is exploring and discovering a favorite on your own, though I’ve saved several recommendations in my Google Maps guide. There is a small charge if you wish to take the elevator to the top, but you can also walk up the stairs for free.

**Saigon Central Post Office** is one of the most beautiful historical buildings in the city. Inside, you’ll find high ceilings, detailed murals, and a variety of postcards and souvenirs for sale. We sent three postcards home, all of which arrived successfully.

**Bến Thành Market** is the spot if you’re looking to do all your shopping in one place. You’ll find everything from handbags and watches to Vietnamese goods, both locally made and imported. Haggling is expected here. A helpful tip: walking away often results in getting the price you want.

**Take a Grab bike ride** in the motorbike capital of the world. Taking a Grab Bike is usually faster than going by car, especially during rush hour. If you’re short on time or want to experience the city like a local, a motorbike is the way to go. If you would like to rent a bike for your trip, I would advise you to triple-check the permit requirements. Foreigners are often stopped to confirm proper paperwork. 

**Củ Chi Tunnels** are a nearly full-day excursion from HCMC and provides insight into Vietnam’s history during the Vietnam War. The tour includes visits to preserved tunnels and several planned activities. There is also an optional add-on to shoot an AK-47 or other historic firearms if that interests you. We booked our tour through GetYourGuide, which you can find [here.](https://www.getyourguide.com/ho-chi-minh-city-l272/ho-chi-minh-city-cu-chi-tunnels-luxury-group-tour-ampm-t195248/)


#### Where to Eat in Ho Chi Minh City

**Ben Nghe Street Food Market** is an approachable introduction to Vietnamese street food. It offers a wide variety of dishes and plenty of outdoor seating, making it a great place to sample multiple foods in one stop.

**Pizza 4P’s** is one of the best spots in HCMC if you're craving pizza. Asia does pizza exceptionally well, and this restaurant lives up to the hype. There are several locations throughout the city.

HCMC was our final stop in Vietnam after more than three weeks of traveling, so we slowed down a bit on adventurous eating. Our Airbnb at De La Sol had two incredible pools, which were essential for escaping the city heat.

One of our favorite meals came from wandering District 4 and spotting a group of middle school kids eating something that looked incredible. When we asked where they got it, they told us their friend made it and offered to text him. We sat down at the café next door, ordered drinks, and soon a man arrived with two plates of crispy pork, rice, vegetables, and hot sauce.

From our time in Hà Nội and Đà Nẵng, we learned an important rule: the smaller the chair, the better the phở. The Michelin Guide is an excellent resource for narrowing down which of the hundreds of Vietnamese restaurants are worth visiting and almost guarantees a delicious meal.
